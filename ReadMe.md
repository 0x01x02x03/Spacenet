# Spacenet

Spacenet is a Tor based python botnet meant for credential stealing .

This project is complete with a full explained UsersGuide so this ReadMe.md is just to expose a fast description of this software .

__NOTE:__ Something inside the UsersGuide doesn't reflect the current version but the Web Gui is intuitive so it's not necessary to update the Doc.

__IMPORTANT:__ Pip doesn't always generate a good 'requirements.txt' file , if for some reasons you can't install via .txt file just start the server.py file with python and install the libraries that the compiler can't find.

Ex:

'Error: No module named CherryPy'

So now you can just type :

'sudo pip install CherryPy'

__Remember that this software is only for educational purposes and creators don't take any responsability of the use by other users.__
